# Anomaly Detection

DeepMed's anomaly detection identifies unusual patterns or outliers in medical data.

## Anomaly Detection Methods

The platform offers several approaches:
- Statistical detection (Z-score, IQR)
- Isolation Forest
- One-Class SVM
- Deep learning autoencoders

## Using Anomaly Detection

1. Select a dataset from your workspace
2. Choose an anomaly detection method
3. Configure detection parameters (sensitivity, threshold)
4. Run the detection process
5. Review results with highlighted anomalies
6. Export reports for further analysis

## Applications

- Identifying outliers in patient data
- Quality control for medical imaging
- Detecting unusual patterns in longitudinal studies
- Finding data recording errors
