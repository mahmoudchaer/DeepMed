# Training Models

DeepMed simplifies training classification models for medical data analysis.

## Classification Models

Categorize medical data (e.g., diagnoses, patient outcomes).

- Select your prepared dataset from your workspace
- Define your target classes and features
- Choose training parameters (model type, validation strategy)
- Monitor training progress through the interactive dashboard
- Review performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score
- Save your model for future use or export it

The platform provides several classification algorithms optimized for medical data.
