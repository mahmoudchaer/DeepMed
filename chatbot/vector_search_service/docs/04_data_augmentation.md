# Data Augmentation

## What is Data Augmentation?

Data augmentation increases your dataset size by creating variations of existing data, improving model robustness and reducing overfitting.

## Supported Augmentation Techniques

### For Tabular Data
- Feature noise addition
- Synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE)
- Value randomization
- Missing value simulation

### For Image Data
- Rotation, flipping, and cropping
- Brightness and contrast adjustments
- Noise addition
- Zoom variations

## Using Data Augmentation

1. Navigate to the data preparation section
2. Select your dataset
3. Choose appropriate augmentation techniques 
4. Specify augmentation parameters
5. Preview results before applying
6. Save the augmented dataset to your workspace

## Augmentation Levels

Levels 1 (Light) to 5 (Very Strong), balancing diversity and model robustness.
