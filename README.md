# DeepMed: Medical AI Platform

DeepMed is a comprehensive AI platform designed for medical professionals and researchers to leverage machine learning for healthcare applications. The platform provides tools for data processing, model training, prediction, and AI-powered medical assistance.

## üöÄ Features

- **Tabular Data Analysis**: Process and analyze medical data tables with advanced cleaning and feature selection
- **Medical Image Processing**: Train and use deep learning models for medical image analysis
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify abnormal patterns in medical data using autoencoder-based anomaly detection
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhance medical datasets with sophisticated augmentation techniques
- **AI-Powered Chatbot**: Get medical AI assistance with a context-aware chatbot
- **Pipeline Integration**: Streamlined end-to-end workflows for medical AI applications
- **User Management**: Secure authentication and project management
- **Azure Integration**: Secure secret management via Azure Key Vault

## üîß Technical Architecture

DeepMed is built on a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **Flask Web Application**: Main application interface
- **Machine Learning Services**: Specialized containerized services for different ML tasks
- **Database Layer**: User data, training runs, and model storage
- **Chatbot Services**: AI assistant with RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) capabilities
- **Storage Services**: Management of files and model artifacts

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- MySQL Database
- Azure Key Vault (for production environments)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment
```
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
```
3. Install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Configure Azure Key Vault (see Configuration section)
5. Initialize the database
```
python db/init_db.py
```
6. Initialize ChromaDB for vector storage (required for chatbot services)
```
python -c "import chromadb; chromadb.Client().reset()"
```
7. Start the application
```
python app_api.py
```

## üîê Configuration

The application uses Azure Key Vault for secure configuration management. No `.env` files are required. Instead, add the following secrets to your Azure Key Vault:

- `MYSQLUSER`: MySQL database username
- `MYSQLPASSWORD`: MySQL database password
- `MYSQLHOST`: MySQL server hostname
- `MYSQLPORT`: MySQL server port
- `MYSQLDB`: MySQL database name
- `SECRETKEY`: Flask application secret key
- `OPENAIAPIKEY`: OpenAI API key for LLM services
- `AZURESTORAGEACCOUNT`: Azure Storage account name
- `AZURESTORAGEKEY`: Azure Storage access key
- `AZURECONTAINER`: Azure Storage container name
- `SYSTEM_PROMPT_VALUE`: System prompt for the chatbot
- `VAULT_URL`: URL of your Azure Key Vault (already set in keyvault.py)

The application accesses these secrets directly from Azure Key Vault using the `keyvault.py` module, which handles authentication and secret retrieval.

## üö¢ Docker Deployment

DeepMed is designed to run as a set of microservices using Docker. To deploy with Docker Compose:

```
docker-compose up -d
```
