    'r2': 'R² (Coefficient of Determination): Represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. Values range from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect prediction.',
    'rmse': "RMSE (Root Mean Square Error): Measures the average magnitude of the error. It's the square root of the average of squared differences between predicted and actual values.",
    'mae': 'MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.',
    'mse': 'MSE (Mean Squared Error): The average of the squares of the errors—the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value.'
