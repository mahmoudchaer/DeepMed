                    <h2 class="section-title">Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
                    <p>
                        At DeepMed, privacy isn't just a feature—it's the foundation of our platform. We've built our 
                        entire service around the principle that your medical data deserves the highest level of protection 
                        and security.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a platform designed for healthcare professionals, we understand the critical importance of 
                        data privacy and security in the medical field. Our privacy-first approach ensures compliance with 
                        global regulations including GDPR and HIPAA.
                    </p>

                    <h3>How We Handle Your Data</h3>
                    <p>
                        DeepMed employs end-to-end encryption for all data processing. Your uploaded datasets never leave 
                        your control—all model training and inference happen locally with no external data sharing. We do 
                        not store or access your medical datasets beyond the immediate processing required to deliver our services.
                    </p>
